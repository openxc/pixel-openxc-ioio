IOIO for OpenXC
=====================
This library for IOIO is based on the primary IOIO-library found in https://github.com/ytai/ioio/.

The accompanying android project for use with this library is located https://github.com/openxc/pixel-openxc-android

The board provides a host machine the capability of interfacing with external hardware over a variety of commonly used protocols. The original IOIO board has been specifically designed to work with Android devices. The newer IOIO-OTG ("on the go") boards work with both Android devices and PC's (details here). The IOIO board can be connected to its host over USB or Bluetooth, and provides a high-level Java API on the host side for using its I/O functions as if they were an integral part of the client. The IOIO-wiki here https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki, provides further details about setting up the library and troubleshooting.

See http://ledpixelart.com/developers.html for instructions to write your own app for PIXEL.

FIRMWARE INFO - Most developers will not need to touch the firmware and you can ignore this section. You only need to worry about the firmware if you're making a
fundamental change to how PIXEL works. This is a fork of the RGB-LED branch of the IOIO repository on Github https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki. The 
major changes from the RGB-LED branch are as follows:

1. Bluetooth name is changed from IOIO to PIXEL
2. The IOIO Loop frequency is changed from 1 Khz to 30 hz (ie, 30 times a second)
3. On soft reset, the pins used by the LED matrix (see pins below) are not reset. This is to keep the matrix going after the Android device has been disconnected.


For reference, here's the IOIO pins used by PIXEL. You only care about this however if you're doing a firmware modification. The 

Pixel's firmware is a modified version of the standard IOIO board app firmware which was developed by Ytai Ben-Tsvi specifically to interface with the LED matrix hardware used by Pixel.

Below are the IOIO pins used by Pixel.  for an explanation of IOIO Pins.
